        <div class="joejoke">
        <p>"Who’s Joe?" a distant voice asks.</p>

        <p>Instantly everyone nearby hears the sound of 1,000s of bricks rapidly shuffling towards his location.</p>

        <p>The earth itself seemed to cry out in agony, until finally the ground itself split open and a horrific creature crawled from the ground, covered in mucus and tar.</p>

        <p>”Joe Momma…” the creature whispered.</p>

        <p>The man cried out in pain as he disintegrated into dust, and the whole world fell silent in fear.</p>

        <p>"I did a little trolling." the wretched creature remarked before burrowing back into the earth.</p>
